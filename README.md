  <h1>QA Guidelines</h1>
</div>

A sanity-forward alternative or complement to traditional tests for AI generated code.

QA guidelines aim to mimic how a human manually tests software, whether that be for a web app, an SDK, or your favorite tools. It's quick and easy to set up (and iterate upon) yet effective at catching regressions.

## How it works

Add a `QA.md` file to any module in your project to define its *QA Guidelines*. The QA agent is responsible for generating a QA report for all QA-able modules.

### 1. The QA.md Files

Each module gets a `QA.md` file at its root that acts as an executable spec:

- **Requirements** — tools and environment variables needed
- **Setup** — how to install and start the module
- **Test Steps** — numbered steps, each explaining how to verify a piece of the system
- **Success Criteria** — what must pass for QA to succeed
- **Cleanup** (optional)

### 2. The QA Agent

The QA agent finds modules with QA guideline files, conducts QA for each module in parallel, generating sub-reports along the way - which all gets combined, finally amalgamating in a pass/fail report that breaks down what the agent "saw" and its analysis on whether or not the success criteria was met.

The QA agent's workflow consists of...

1. **Discovers** all modules with QA.md files across the project
2. **Runs** each QA in parallel (using the Claude Agent SDK to run an agent per module)
3. **Aggregates** results into pass/fail per module
4. **Generates** timestamped markdown reports

### 3. The QA Report

A QA Report is a timestamped pass/fail report that breaks down what the agent "saw" and whether the success criteria was met. It consists of:

1. Top level QA result: `PASS` or `FAIL`
2. Overview of outcome of each module's QA steps
3. High level analysis on whether success criteria was met for all nested modules

## Why It Works

- Module authors verify their own QA steps work (deterministically, once)
- The agent handles the tedium of re-running those steps later
- Reports track QA state over time by branch and timestamp

## Where QA Guidelines Pay Off

QA guidelines catch what unit tests structurally can't. Target them at:

- **Process boundaries** — CLIs invoked with real args, servers hit with real requests, MCP handshakes. Unit tests stop at the seam; QA crosses it.
- **Wiring and config** — the built artifact actually runs: ports bind, env vars resolve, `bin` entries exist.
- **AI-generated code** — everything compiles and tests pass, but does it run? QA the module before considering the session done.
- **Pre-release gates** — QA the modules touched since the last release tag.
- **Fresh checkouts and dependency upgrades** — offline checks double as onboarding validation and upgrade canaries.

A pure library with strong unit tests needs only a thin QA.md (build, import, one smoke call) — or none.

## Requirements

- `node` (v18+)
- `jq`
- `git` (for branch/commit info in reports)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

## Usage

**Preferred: the `/qa` skill** (from the `qa` bag in `bags/qa/`). It runs the same discover → run → aggregate → report flow via parallel subagents in the main session — no programmatic Claude invocation, no API key round-trips:

```
/qa                        # whole project
/qa --module=packages/db   # one module
/qa --filter=mcp           # modules matching a substring
/qa --strict               # fail if any module lacks a QA.md
```

The `qa` bag also ships a `create-qa-guidelines` skill for authoring new QA.md files.

Sessions opt into the skill via the **`qa` trait** — no profile bag enablement needed:

```bash
barry bag sync-traits qa        # one-time: register the trait (with its skills) in the DB
barry start --traits qa          # CLI session with the /qa skill mounted
```

For server-spawned sessions, check `qa` in the web app's New Session traits picker, or make it a profile default with `barry profile add-traits <profile> qa`.

**Fallback: the bash orchestrator** — for headless/CI use, or outside a Claude session:

```bash
./bin/qa ./path/to/project           # or via the `qa` bin if installed
./bin/qa --module=packages/db .
./bin/qa --strict .
```

The orchestrator searches the directory (and all nested directories) for `QA.md` files, runs each one in parallel via `claude --print`, and generates a report in `<project>/.qa-reports/` (add that directory to your `.gitignore`).

## Writing `QA.md` Files

Every module, service, or application should have a `QA.md` file at its root that defines how to verify it works correctly. This file is the single source of truth for setup, test steps, and success criteria.

A `QA.md` file has four required sections: requirements, setup, QA steps, and success criteria.

```markdown
# QA: mock-web-app

A todo list web app with an HTML frontend and JSON API. Zero dependencies — just Node.

## Requirements

- `node` (v18+)
- Playwright MCP server

## Setup

1. Start the server: `node qa/mock-web-app/server.js &`
2. Wait for "Todo app listening" message

## Test Steps

Use the Playwright MCP server to perform all browser interactions and API calls.

### 1. Server starts and responds

Navigate to http://localhost:9876/health

**Expected:** Page loads successfully with JSON containing `"status": "ok"`

### 2. Homepage serves HTML

Navigate to http://localhost:9876/

**Expected:** Page title is "Todo App"

### 3. Homepage has a form

On the homepage, look for the add todo form.

**Expected:** Form with id "add-form" is visible

### 4. Todo list starts empty

Check that no todos are displayed initially.

**Expected:** Todo list is empty

### 5. Create a todo

Use the form to add a todo with title "Buy milk".

**Expected:** Todo "Buy milk" appears in the list

### 6. Toggle todo done

Click the toggle/checkbox button on the "Buy milk" todo to mark it as done.

**Expected:** Todo shows as completed/done

### 7. Delete todo

Click the delete button on the "Buy milk" todo.

**Expected:** Todo is removed from the list

### 8. List is empty after delete

Verify the todo list is empty again.

**Expected:** No todos displayed

### 9. Invalid create returns error

Try to submit the form with an empty title.

**Expected:** Error message or validation prevents submission

### 10. Not found handling

Navigate to http://localhost:9876/api/todos/999

**Expected:** 404 response or "Not found" message

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Server starts and health check responds
- [ ] Homepage serves HTML with form
- [ ] CRUD operations work (create, read, toggle, delete)
- [ ] Validation returns error for missing title
- [ ] Missing resources return 404
```

### Offline and Online Checks

For modules with external dependencies (database, network services, credentials), split the test steps into two groups:

```markdown
## Test Steps

### Offline checks

Always runnable: build, type-check, CLI help, anything self-contained.

### Online checks

Require a live dependency (e.g. `QA_DATABASE_URL`, a running server). State how
to detect the dependency is unavailable — these steps are then SKIPPED, not
FAILED, so QA stays green on a fresh checkout.
```

See `packages/db/QA.md` and `servers/api/QA.md` for real examples of this split.

### No Interactive Checkpoints

Every step must run without human input — no "say 'Approved' and observe the transition". If a workflow needs multi-turn interaction, cover those state transitions with programmatic E2E tests instead, or list them under a `## Manual Checks` section that the agent ignores.

## Test Fixtures and Mocks

Some modules can't be QA'd against real dependencies — the external service might be unavailable, rate-limited, or stateful in ways that make tests unreliable. In these cases, write a lightweight mock that your QA steps run against instead.

### When to use mocks

- **External APIs** — third-party services you don't control
- **Databases with seed data** — when tests need a known starting state
- **Self-testing** — verifying a test framework against a known-good target (see `qa/mock-web-app/` in this repo, which exists so the QA agent can test itself)

```
my-module/
├── QA.md
├── mocks/
│   └── mock-api/
│       └── server.js
└── src/
```

Then reference the mock in your QA.md Setup or Test Steps:

```markdown
## Setup

1. Start the mock API: `node mocks/mock-api/server.js &`
2. Start the module: `API_URL=http://localhost:9999 npm start &`
```

> If your mock starts a process, add a Cleanup section to kill it:

## Configuration

### Ignoring Directories

Create a `.qaignore` file in your project root to skip directories during discovery:

```
node_modules
dist
vendor
```

### Tool Permissions

Add a `<!-- tools: Bash,Read -->` comment to your `QA.md` to control which tools Claude can use. Defaults to `Bash,Read`.
